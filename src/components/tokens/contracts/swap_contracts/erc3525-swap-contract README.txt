ERC-3525 to ERC-20 Swap Contract for Tokenized Assets
I've developed a swap contract designed specifically for converting ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible Tokens to ERC-20 tokens, enabling liquidity and redemption mechanisms for slot-based tokenized assets.
Key Features

Slot-Based Token Wrapping:

Creates dedicated ERC-20 tokens for each ERC-3525 slot
Maintains separate wrapped token contracts for different asset classes
Preserves slot value and token ID relationships


Value-Based Conversion:

Properly handles the semi-fungible nature of ERC-3525 tokens
Supports partial value transfers from semi-fungible tokens
Calculates conversion rates using NAV per slot


Redemption Queue System:

Processes redemption requests in order
Handles both full and partial token redemptions
Maintains an auditable record of all redemption transactions


Flexible NAV Calculation:

Primary pricing via Chainlink Oracle
Fallback calculation based on total slot value
Owner can manually update NAV when needed



How It Works

Slot-Specific ERC-20 Creation:
CopyFund Manager → Create Wrapped Token for Slot → Dedicated ERC-20 for Asset Class
Each slot (representing an asset class, tranche, or value category) gets its own dedicated ERC-20 token.
Wrapping Process (ERC-3525 → ERC-20):
CopyInvestor → Deposit ERC-3525 Token (full or partial value) → Receive Slot-Specific ERC-20 Tokens
The investor deposits their ERC-3525 token (or a portion of its value) and receives equivalent ERC-20 tokens based on the current NAV of that slot.
Trading Experience:
CopyInvestor → Trade Slot-Specific ERC-20 Tokens on Exchanges
Each wrapped token represents a specific asset class (slot) and can be traded on standard ERC-20 exchanges.
Unwrapping Process (ERC-20 → ERC-3525):
CopyInvestor → Burn Wrapped ERC-20 Tokens → Queue Redemption Request → Receive ERC-3525 Tokens
When unwrapping, the system finds suitable ERC-3525 tokens to fulfill the redemption, optimizing for minimal token fragmentation.

Unique Benefits for ERC-3525 Assets

Preserves Asset Classification: Unlike generic wrappers, this contract maintains the slot-specific nature of the underlying assets, creating dedicated liquidity pools for each asset class.
Handles Partial Values: Properly manages the semi-fungible nature of ERC-3525 tokens, allowing partial value transfers and optimizing redemptions.
NAV-Aware Conversion: Calculates wrapping and unwrapping amounts based on the NAV of each specific slot, ensuring fair value representation.
Redemption Optimization: The redemption process attempts to minimize fragmentation of ERC-3525 tokens when fulfilling requests.
Comprehensive Tracking: Maintains detailed records of deposited tokens and their original owners, ensuring proper attribution during redemptions.

This contract is particularly well-suited for:

Structured financial products with different tranches
Tokenized credit products with varied risk profiles
Real estate tokens with different property classes
Any semi-fungible assets that benefit from improved liquidity

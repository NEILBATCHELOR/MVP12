# Active Context

## Current Focus

The Web3 Integration Framework is currently in active development, with a focus on building a comprehensive, multi-chain solution for blockchain interactions. The framework includes adapters, transaction builders, and wallet management systems for a wide range of blockchain networks.

## Key Components

### Transaction System

The transaction system appears to be well developed with:

1. **AbstractTransactionBuilder**: A base class providing common functionality for transaction builders across different blockchains
2. **Blockchain-Specific Builders**:
   - `EthereumTransactionBuilder`: For Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains
   - `SolanaTransactionBuilder`: For Solana blockchain
   - `RippleTransactionBuilder`: For XRP Ledger
   - `NEARTransactionBuilder`: For NEAR Protocol
3. **TransactionBuilderFactory**: Factory for creating appropriate transaction builders
4. **TransactionMonitor**: System for tracking transaction status and notifying listeners
5. **Multi-Signature Support**: Functionality for creating and managing multi-signature wallets

### Blockchain Adapters

The adapter architecture is being implemented with:

1. **BlockchainAdapter Interface**: Standardized interface for blockchain operations
2. **Blockchain-Specific Adapters**:
   - EVM-compatible chain adapters
   - Non-EVM chain adapters
3. **BlockchainFactory**: Factory for creating and managing adapters

### Wallet Management

The wallet system includes:

1. **WalletManager**: Central component for wallet operations
2. **WalletGeneratorFactory**: Creates wallet generators for different blockchains
3. **WalletAddressReceiver**: Handles WebSocket connections for receiving wallet addresses
4. **WalletContext**: React context for application-wide access to wallet functionality

## Current Issues

Based on the linter errors, there appear to be a few issues that need resolution:

1. **Missing Module References**:
   - `BaseTransactionBuilder` module cannot be found
   - `../types` module cannot be found

2. **Parameter Mismatch**:
   - `TransactionMonitor.getInstance()` is called without required arguments

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps appear to be:

1. **Resolve Module References**: Fix the missing module issues by creating or correctly importing these modules
2. **Fix Parameter Mismatch**: Update the `transactionMonitor` export to provide required parameters
3. **Complete Implementation**: Finish implementing any incomplete adapter or transaction builder methods
4. **Improve Documentation**: Enhance the documentation for all components
5. **Add Testing**: Create tests for all major components and cross-chain functionalities

## Focus Areas

The framework is currently focusing on these key aspects:

1. **Cross-Chain Consistency**: Ensuring a uniform API across different blockchains
2. **Transaction Handling**: Robust transaction creation, signing, and monitoring
3. **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with various wallet providers
4. **Error Management**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Real-World Testing**: Validating operations on actual blockchain networks

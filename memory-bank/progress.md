# Progress

## Current Status

The Web3 Integration Framework is in active development, with several key components already implemented:

### Implemented Components

#### Transaction System
- `TransactionBuilder.ts`: Interface definition and base abstract class for transaction builders
- `TransactionBuilderFactory.ts`: Factory for creating blockchain-specific transaction builders
- `EthereumTransactionBuilder.ts`: Implementation for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains
- `SolanaTransactionBuilder.ts`: Implementation for Solana blockchain
- `RippleTransactionBuilder.ts`: Implementation for XRP Ledger
- `NEARTransactionBuilder.ts`: Implementation for NEAR Protocol

#### Blockchain Adapters
- `BlockchainFactory.ts`: Factory for creating blockchain-specific adapters
- Various adapter implementations for different blockchains (both EVM and non-EVM)

#### Wallet Management
- `WalletManager.ts`: Core functionality for wallet connections and operations
- `MultiSigWallet.ts`: Implementation of multi-signature wallet functionality
- Wallet generators for different blockchains

#### Token Operations
- `TokenManager.ts`: Token operations and management
- `ERC4626Mechanisms.ts`: Support for the ERC4626 tokenized vault standard

### Work in Progress

The project has several areas that are still in development:

1. **Module References**: There are some missing module references that need to be resolved
2. **Parameter Handling**: Some components have parameter mismatches that need fixing
3. **Cross-Chain Testing**: More comprehensive testing across different blockchains
4. **Documentation**: More detailed documentation for all components

## What Works

Based on the reviewed code, the following functionality appears to be operational:

1. **EVM-Chain Transactions**: Basic transaction handling for Ethereum and other EVM chains
2. **Solana Transactions**: Transaction building and monitoring for Solana
3. **Factory Patterns**: The factory pattern implementation for creating appropriate adapters and builders
4. **Transaction Monitoring**: The system for tracking transaction status and notifying listeners
5. **Wallet Generation**: Basic wallet generation for different blockchains

## What's Left to Build

Several areas still need implementation or refinement:

1. **Complete Non-EVM Support**: Finish implementing adapters and transaction builders for all non-EVM chains
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: More sophisticated error recovery mechanisms
3. **Advanced Transaction Features**:
   - Transaction batching
   - Transaction simulation improvements
   - Cross-chain transaction coordination
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: End-to-end testing across all supported chains
5. **Performance Optimization**: Improving efficiency, especially for resource-intensive operations
6. **Security Auditing**: Thorough security review of all crypto operations
7. **Documentation Completion**: Complete API documentation with examples

## Current Challenges

The project faces several challenges:

1. **Cross-Chain Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent API across fundamentally different blockchain architectures
2. **Module Organization**: Ensuring proper module references and organization
3. **Type Safety**: Balancing TypeScript's static typing with the dynamic nature of blockchain data
4. **Error Normalization**: Creating a consistent error handling approach across different blockchain APIs
5. **Transaction Monitoring**: Reliably tracking transaction status across chains with different confirmation mechanisms

## Next Actions

Based on the current state, these are the recommended next actions:

1. **Fix Module References**: Resolve the missing module issues identified in linter errors:
   - Create or correctly import `BaseTransactionBuilder`
   - Create or correctly import types from `../types`

2. **Fix Parameter Mismatch**: Update the `transactionMonitor` export to provide the required blockchain and provider parameters

3. **Complete Implementation**: Finish implementing any incomplete adapter or transaction builder methods

4. **Add Test Suite**: Create a comprehensive test suite covering all major components

5. **Enhance Documentation**: Improve documentation with more examples and detailed API references

## Known Issues

1. `TransactionMonitor.ts` has missing module references:
   ```
   4 | import { BaseTransactionBuilder } from './BaseTransactionBuilder';
   Err | Cannot find module './BaseTransactionBuilder' or its corresponding type declarations.
   5 | import { Blockchain } from '../types';
   Err | Cannot find module '../types' or its corresponding type declarations.
   ```

2. `TransactionMonitor.ts` has a parameter mismatch in the singleton instance:
   ```
   349 | export const transactionMonitor = TransactionMonitor.getInstance();
   Err | Expected 2 arguments, but got 0.
   ```

3. There may be other issues not visible in the examined code, such as compatibility issues between different blockchain implementations.

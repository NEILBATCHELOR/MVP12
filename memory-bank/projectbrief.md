# Project Brief: Web3 Integration Framework

## Project Overview

The Web3 Integration Framework is a TypeScript-based library designed to provide a unified, consistent interface for blockchain interactions across multiple networks. It aims to abstract away the complexities and differences between various blockchain protocols, allowing developers to build cross-chain applications with minimal blockchain-specific code.

## Core Objectives

1. **Blockchain Abstraction**: Create a consistent API that works across Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and other major blockchains
2. **Developer Experience**: Provide an intuitive, well-documented interface that reduces the learning curve for blockchain integration
3. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript to ensure compile-time safety and excellent IDE support
4. **Extensibility**: Enable easy addition of new blockchains and features through a modular architecture
5. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and reliability in blockchain interactions
6. **Lightweight**: Minimize bundle size impact through modular imports and tree-shaking support

## Key Features

### Wallet Integration
- Connect to multiple wallet providers (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Phantom, etc.)
- Account management and switching
- Network detection and switching
- Balance checking
- Message signing

### Transaction Management
- Transaction creation and signing
- Fee estimation and management
- Transaction monitoring and status updates
- Transaction history retrieval
- Transaction acceleration/cancellation

### Token Operations
- Token transfers
- Token approvals and allowances
- Token balance checking
- Token metadata retrieval

### Smart Contract Interactions
- Contract method calls
- Event monitoring
- Contract deployment
- ABI management

### Cross-Chain Support
- Unified API across supported chains
- Chain-specific feature extensions
- Chain detection and switching

## Target Audience

1. **Web3 Application Developers**: Teams building dApps that need to interact with multiple blockchains
2. **Web2 Companies Adding Web3 Features**: Traditional companies integrating blockchain functionality
3. **Framework and SDK Developers**: Developers building higher-level tools on top of blockchain infrastructure
